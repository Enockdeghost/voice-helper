## üéôÔ∏è What Can It Do?

- **Voice Recognition:** Listen for and execute spoken commands (using your microphone).
- **Text-to-Speech:** Talks back to you using pyttsx3.
- **System Control:** Open Notepad, Calculator, Browser, File Explorer, or control system power (shutdown, restart, sleep).
- **Volume Control:** Instantly change volume or mute with your voice.
- **Time & Date:** Ask for the current time or date.
- **Web Search:** Just say "search ..." and it Googles for you.
- **System Monitoring:** See real-time CPU, memory, and disk usage, with beautiful progress bars.
- **Command History:** Review what you‚Äôve said and what was executed.
- **Quick Actions:** One-click buttons for common tasks.
- **Modern GUI:** Sleek, dark-themed PyQt5 interface, stylish buttons, and easy-to-read info panels.
- **Offline/Online:** If offline, will keep trying to get back online for voice services.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

- **Start the app.**
- **Click the microphone button** ("üé§ Click to Speak")‚Äîit will turn red and start listening.
- **Say a command!** Try things like:
    - "Open notepad"
    - "Search weather in Nairobi"
    - "What time is it?"
    - "Shutdown"
    - "Volume up"
    - "Open browser"

- **Use quick-action buttons** for instant access to common tools.

If you get no response (offline), the app will keep trying to reconnect for voice recognition.
